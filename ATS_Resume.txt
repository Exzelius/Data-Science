PROJECTS
Companion Tuning: GPT-Powered Voice AI for AR/VR March 2025 - April 2025
Dublin, Ireland
• Built a real-time AI voice companion in AR/VR using Unity and WebSocket-based Python backend.
• Set the Unity Scenes and Animations, fine-tuned GPT-Neo (125M) with LoRA for personalized, low-latency conversation.
• Used Whisper (speech-to-text) and gTTS (speech synthesis) for smooth speech interaction.
• Deployed lightweight, emotionally responsive LLMs on local GPU for immersive experience.
Optical Amplifier Gain Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms January 2025 – April 2025
Dublin, Ireland
• Modelled EDFA optical amplifier behaviour using ML Algorithms such as LightGBM, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
• Compared prediction accuracy under varying channel loading; Neural Networks showed highest accuracy with Mean Absolute Error
0.08 dB.
